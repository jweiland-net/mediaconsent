   :width: 250px
   :alt: Content Fields

   Fields for Content Provider and HTML Content

Use **Content Source** for selecting the content provider. If it is not listed, choose "Other" which will result in a more general message in frontend.

**HTML Code** then contains the HTML snippet used to embed the social media content. These snippets can be fetched directly from the Providers as you probably know. After the user has clicked to agree, this HTML will be loaded dynamically.
